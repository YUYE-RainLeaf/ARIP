# ARIP3

A Python software for quantitative calculation of residue interactions in proteins or nucleic acids, supporting platforms such as Windows/Linux/MacOS.

It can simultaneously calculate contact area and volume, and supports analysis of PDB files containing multiple MODELs.
Supports most non-standard residues and ligands.

### Getting Started

- Download and use immediately
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir`
  
- Supports input of files or paths
  - The input file must be in PDB format, both compressed and uncompressed are acceptable, with or without suffix
  - The input path should only contain correctly formatted files and no secondary paths
  - If a path is input, multithreading will be used automatically
  - Water molecules will be automatically discarded when reading non-standard residues

### Optional Parameters

- Custom output path
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -o your/output/path`
  
- Enhanced precision mode, more time-consuming
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -e`
  
- Use the lower cutoff, contacts with area and volume less than the cutoff will be discarded. The default is 0.5 and 0.2
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -c` # Contacts with area less than 0.5 and volume less than 0.2 will be discarded
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -c 1.0 0.5` # Contacts with area less than 1.0 and volume less than 0.5 will be discarded
  - Note, this will apply to all proteins, nucleic acids, non-standard residues, and ligands

- Use a custom distance to determine whether two atoms are in contact. Contact is determined when the minimum distance between two atoms is less than the custom distance. The default is 0
- `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -d` # Contact is determined when the minimum distance between two atoms is less than 0
- `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -d 0.5` # Contact is determined when the minimum distance between two atoms is less than 0.5
- The minimum distance refers to the smallest distance between two atoms when they are considered as spheres with their vdW

- Custom multithreading quantity
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -t threads_number`
  - If the -t parameter is not specified, or the number of threads entered is greater than the number of CPUs, multithreading will be set automatically according to the number of CPUs
  
- Calculate volume based on atomic overlap weighted algorithm
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -w`
  - The more overlapping atoms, the greater the volume weight
  - Specifically, the volume represented by each point is multiplied by the number of atoms that contain this point, and if it is located in N atoms at the same time, it will be Ã—N
  
- Save the output results in .gz compressed format to save storage space
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -z`
  - The created folder name will have a '_z' suffix to distinguish it

- Output .csv file for each residue
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -r`
  - This may consume storage space and reduce write speed during large-scale runs

- Calculate only surface area and other parameters, excluding volume
  - `python3 run.py your/file/or/dir -s`
  - This can be used when volume values are not required, significantly improving speed 

### Output Style

##### Folder
- For each successfully analyzed PDB file, a new folder with the same name will be created to store the analysis results
- If the PDB file contains multiple MODELs, subfolders will be created under the same name folder to store them separately

##### Interaction Types

- Protein
  - Non-covalent interaction (NC, Non-Covalent)
	- HB: Hydrogen Bond
    - AROM: Aromatic-Aromatic Contact
    - PHOB: Hydrophobic-Hydrophobic Contact
	- DC: Distabilizing Contact
	- OTHER: Other van der Waals interactions
  - Covalent interaction (Cova, Covalent)
    - SS: Disulfide Bond
	- PB: Peptide Bond
	
- Nucleic Acid
  - Non-covalent interaction
    - DD: DNA-DNA Contact
	- DR: DNA-RNA Contact
	- RR: RNA-RNA Contact
  - Covalent interaction
    - PD: Phosphodiester Bond
	
- Other
  - BSA: Buried Surface Area, that is, the sum of the contact surface of each atom in the residue
  - Volu: Volume, contact volume
  - AOWV: Atomic Overlap Weighted Volume
  - UNDEF: Undefined, interactions related to non-standard residues that have not been judged

##### Summary Information
- Files starting with '_ALL' contain all atom-atom contact information, including atom type, contact distance, surface, volume, etc.
- Files starting with '_SUM' contain each residue's dihedral angles (proteins only), covalent and non-covalent BSA and contact volume, etc.

##### Success Information
- If the PDB file only has one MODEL
  - "The PDB {name} run OK, time cost: {time}s"

- If the PDB file contains multiple MODELs
  - "The PDB {name}MODEL{num} run OK, time cost: {time}s"

#### Error Information

- The input is not a valid file or path
  - "{input} is not a valid file or directory"

- The cutoff is specified, but no correctly formatted numbers are entered
  - "Lower cutoff must be TWO values like 1.0 0.5, or leave it blank to use the default values 0.5 0.2"

- The PDB file is incomplete
  - "The file {name} may be corrupted or contain incomplete MODEL"

- The PDB format is incorrect
  - "The file {name} is unsupported format"

- Insufficient memory or the input file does not contain valid atoms
  - "Required memory: {required_memory_GB} GB. Skipping file {name} due to insufficient memory or no valid atoms"

- Unable to analyze for other reasons
  - "The file {name} cannot be analyzed, perhaps it contains unsupported format, or no valid atoms"
  
### Visualization

- Provides a simple function to visualize the spatial position of heavy atoms
  - `python3 vis.py your/file`
  
  - Supports input of PDB files or XYZ files
    - PDB files, both compressed and uncompressed are acceptable, with or without suffix
    - Does not support input of paths
    - For PDB containing multiple MODELs, pictures of each MODEL can be output
    - If an unsupported format is input, it will output `unsupported file: {name}`

- For structures that have been analyzed, heatmaps of residue contacts can be drawn for PDBs with multiple models
  - `python3 heatmap.py your/dir column`
  - The input path should contain the ARIP analysis results
    - Only applicable to PDBs with multiple models
    - The input column is the column you wish to plot in the heatmap, generally one or more of the following:
      - Surface_max, Surface_min, Surface_range, Surface_mean, Surface_rmsd, Surface_cv, Volume_max, Volume_min, Volume_range, Volume_mean, Volume_rmsd, Volume_cv, AOWV_max, AOWV_min, AOWV_range, AOWV_mean, AOWV_rmsd, AOWV_cv
      - If no input column, a heatmap will be drawn for each column by default
    - The x-axis and y-axis of the heatmap are arranged in the order of the residues, starting from A1.
    - If an unsupported format is input, it will output `The heatmap could not be successfully generated due to an error`
